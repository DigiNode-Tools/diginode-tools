# DigiNode Tools

### What's a DigiNode?
A DigiNode is a device that runs a [DigiByte](https://digibyte.org/) Full Node and [DigiAsset Node](https://ipfs.digiassetx.com/) helping to further decentralize the DigiByte ecosystem. 

### What are DigiNode Tools?
DigiNode Tools are a suite of Linux bash scripts that make it really easy to setup, monitor and manage a DigiNode on a Raspberry Pi 4 or Ubuntu/Debian system.
- **DigiNode Setup** - Helps you to install, upgrade, backup and restore your DigiByte and/or DigAsset Node.
- **DigiNode Dashboard** - Provides a live dashboard to quickly check the status of your DigiNode.

### What do I need to run a DigiNode?

- A **Raspberry Pi 4 8Gb** is the recommended device for running a DigiNode. It offers the most user-friendly setup experience. See [here](https://diginode.tools/build-your-own-raspberry-pi-diginode/) for the parts you need.
- DigiNode Tools also runs on most Ubuntu or Debian based systems. ARM64 and x86_64 hardware are both supported. A 64-bit OS is required. For more info, see the [System Requirements](https://diginode.tools/system-requirements/) on the official website.
- DigiNode is designed to operate headless - i.e. no display, keyboard or mouse is required. Everything can be managed remotely from your main computer. (Note: These may be needed during setup on some Linux systems, but are not needed at all for the Raspberry Pi 4.)
