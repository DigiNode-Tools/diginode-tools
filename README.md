# DigiNode Tools

### What's a DigiNode?
A DigiNode is a device that runs a [DigiByte](https://digibyte.org/) Full Node and [DigiAsset Node](https://ipfs.digiassetx.com/) helping to further decentralize the DigiByte ecosystem. 

### What are DigiNode Tools?
DigiNode Tools are a suite of linux bash scripts that make it easy to setup, monitor and manage your DigiNode via the linux command line:
- **DigiNode Setup** - Helps you to install, upgrade, backup and restore your DigiByte and/or DigAsset Node.
- **DigiNode Status Monitor** - Provides a live dashboard to quickly check the status of your DigiNode.

### What do I need to run a DigiNode?

- A **Raspberry Pi 4 8Gb** is the recommended device for running a DigiNode. It offers the most user-friendly setup experience. See [here](/docs/suggested_hardware.md) for the parts you need.
- DigiNode Tools also runs on most Ubuntu or Debian based systems. ARM64 and x86_64 hardware are both supported. A 64-bit OS is required. For more info, see the [Compatibility](#compatibility) section below.
- DigiNode is designed to operate headless - i.e. no display, keyboard or mouse is required. Everything can be managed remotely from your main computer.

## About DigiNode Setup

![DigiNode Setup](images/diginode_install_menu.png)
DigiNode Setup helps you to setup and manage your DigiNode:

- Intuitively walks you though the process of setting up a DigiByte Node and/or DigiAsset Node. 
- Almost no linux command line experience required. Setup is entirely menu-driven.
- Automatically checks hardware and OS at launch and lets you know if your system is compatible, and that there is enough disk space and memory to run a DigiNode.
- Checks if the existing swap file is large enough, and helps create one on low memory devices.
- Installs or upgrades DigiByte and DigiAssets Node software with the latest releases from GitHub.
- Lets you choose whether to run a mainnet or testnet DigiByte Node.
- Optionally install a pre-release version of DigiByte Core, if available, and quickly downgrade back to the release version if needed. (See [Advanced Features](GETSTARTED.md#advanced-features).)
- Creates or updates the digibyte.conf settings file with optimal settings.
- Creates system services (systemd or upstart) to ensure the DigiByte Node and DigiAsset Node stays running 24/7.
- Creates or updates your DigiAsset Node configuration file with your RPC credentials. (This ensures you can always access your wallet from the web UI to mint DigiAssets.)
- Optionally, creates a 'digibyte' user and sets system hostname to 'diginode'. It also enables zeroconf networking (Bonjour) so you can access your node at http://diginode.local - i.e. no need to remember the IP address.
- Installs DigiNode Status Monitor. (see below)

To get started, go [here](GETSTARTED.md). Once installed, DigiNode Setup can be run from the command line by entering: ```diginode-setup```

## Additional Features

![DigiNode Main Menu](images/diginode_main_menu.png)
Once DigiNode Tools have been installed, you can access additional features via the DigiNode Setup menu by entering: ```diginode-setup```

- **Update**: Installs any software updates for your DigiNode, and checks that all services are running correctly. It also ensures that the RPC credentials are correct and that the DigiAsset Node is able to connect with the DigiByte Node. Most DigiNode issues can be solved by performing an Update.
- **Backup**: Helps you to backup your DigiByte wallet and/or your DigiAsset Node settings to an external USB stick.
- **Restore**: Helps you to restore your DigiNode from an existing backup.
- **Ports**: Enable/disable using UPnP to forward required ports.
- **Network**: Switch between running DigiByte Core on mainnet or testnet
- **MOTD**: Enable the custom DigiNode Message of the Day. This displays the DigiNode logo and usage instructions whenever you login via the terminal.
- **Extras**: Install additional software such as the cooling fan software for the Argon ONE case for the Rasperry Pi.
- **Reset**: Gives you the ability to selectively reset your DigiNode settings in the event of a problem.
- **Uninstall**: Unistalls DigiNode software from your system. It lets you choose which individual components you wish to remove. Your DigByte wallet will not be harmed.

## About DigiNode Status Monitor

![DigiNode Status Monitor](images/diginode_status_monitor.png)

DigiNode Status Monitor is a powerful dashboard for monitoring the status of your DigiNode:

- Monitor your DigiNode on your local machine via the command line, locally or remotely over SSH.
- Quickly check that your DigiByte and DigiAsset Nodes are running correctly.
- Displays live DigiByte and DigiAsset data including:
    + Connection Count
    + Block Height (with Sync Progress)
    + IP addresses (local and external)
    + Web UI address 
    + Node uptime
    + Disk, RAM and swap usage
- Periodically checks for software updates to your DigiNode (not more than once every 24 hours) and helps you install them.
- Build-in port checker to ensure the correct ports are open on your router.

DigiNode Status Monitor can be run from the command line by entering: ```diginode```

## Compatibility

- DigiNode Tools should work with most Ubuntu or Debian based systems. A 64-bit OS is required. Both ARM64 and x86_64 hardware are supported. It has been designed with headless operation in mind. A device with at least 8GB RAM is recommended. A Raspberry Pi 4 8Gb is a good choice.
- With 8Gb RAM or more, you can safely run a full DigiNode (DigiByte + DigiAssets). This is the recommended minimum.
- With 4Gb RAM, you can run a DigiByte Node, or a DigiAsset Node, but running both together is not recommended. (Note: By creating a large swap file, it is technically possible to run a full DigiNode with only 4Gb RAM, but performance will be very sluggish. This is fine for testing, but definitely not recommended for long term use. Due the read/write demands placed on the SSD, its lifespan will be significantly decreased.)
- With 2Gb RAM, there is not enough memory to run a DigiByte Node, but you can still run DigiAsset Node. (A DigiAsset Node requires ~2Gb RAM.) See the Advanced Features section below for how to do a 'DigiAsset Node ONLY' setup.
- Regardless of how much memory your device has, it is always sensible to have a swap file. DigiNode Setup can help configure this for you.
- As of December 2022, the DigiByte blockchain currently requires around 43Gb of disk space. If you are setting up a DigiNode, a minimum 90Gb of free disk space is recommended, to allow for future growth.
- When using a Raspberry Pi 4, booting from an SSD via USB is highly recommended. If you have an 8Gb Pi, it is possible to boot from a microSD card, though this is not recommended for long term use.
- If you are interested in building your own DigiNode using a Raspberry Pi 4, you can find a list of the parts you need [here](docs/suggested_hardware.md).

*Note: If you already have a DigiByte Node installed, and simply want to use the DigiNode Status Monitor with it, DigiNode Setup gives you the option to install DigiNode Tools only (i.e. these scripts). They will be installed to: ~/diginode-tools*

DigiNode has been tested and known to work with the following systems:

| **Hardware**          | **Operating System**                               | **Notes**                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi 4 8Gb    | Raspberry Pi OS lite 64-bit (Debian Bullseye)      | This is the recommended configuration. Booting from an SSD, rather than microSD, is highly recommended.     |
| Raspberry Pi 4 8Gb    | Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS 64-bit                     | Booting from an SSD, rather than microSD, is highly recommended.  Note: There is currently a known issue with the recent releases of Ubuntu that causes the menus to become unresponsive when piping though bash. If you experience this, you may want to try using Raspberry Pi OS instead, or run the script locally with the workaround above. |
| Raspberry Pi 4 4Gb    | Raspberry Pi OS lite 64-bit (Debian Bullseye)      | Requires large swap file to run a full DigiNode. Runs slowly. Fine for testing - not recommended for long-term use. Recommended to run either a DigiByte node, or a DigiAsset node, but not both. |
| x86_64 (Intel/AMD)    | Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS 64-bit                     | Tested and working on an Intel Core i3-380M laptop with 8Gb RAM. Requires the Ubuntu workaround explained above. |
