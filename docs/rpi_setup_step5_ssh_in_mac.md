# DigiNode Setup on a Raspberry Pi - Step-by-Step Instructions

Note: If you have not already connected the SSD to your Raspberry Pi and powered it on, then go [here](/docs/rpi_setup_step4_boot_pi.md) to complete STEP 4.

## STEP 5 - Connect to the Pi over SSH from macOS

You will now connect to the Raspberry Pi from your main computer using SSH (Secure Shell). You will then be able to run the DigiNode Setup script.
