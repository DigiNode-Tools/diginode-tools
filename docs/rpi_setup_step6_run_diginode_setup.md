# DigiNode Setup on a Raspberry Pi - Step-by-Step Instructions

IMPORTANT: If you have not yet connected to your Raspberry Pi in the Terminal using SSH, please complete STEP 5 first. Click [here](/docs/rpi_setup_step5_ssh_in_win.md) if you are on Windows, and [here](/docs/rpi_setup_step5_ssh_in_mac.md) for Mac.

## STEP 6 - Run DigiNode Setup

To run the DigiNode Setup script, in the terminal type the command: ```curl -sSL diginode-setup.digibyte.help | bash``` and press return.

DigiNode Setup will start and perform some system checks, before taking you step-by-step with through the setup process.

When prompted to customize your install, choose 'Continue' to stick with the defaults.

Once you reach the main menu, choose to install a 'Full DigiNode' and press return. DigiNode Setup will then start to download and configure the required software.

When asked whether to use uPnP for portforwarding, choose 'Setup Manually'. Before doing so, make a note of the port numbers.

In Step 7, you will learn how to forward these ports on your router.

When prompted to install the custom MOTD, choose Yes.

When prompted to install the IPFS server profile, choose No.

Installation will continue. It will likely take a few minutes to complete. Go grab a coffee.

Note: At several points during the installation, it may look like it has frozen. Just be patient. You should eventually see the message telling you it has been installed.

Next restart the Raspberry Pi, by typing ```sudo reboot``` followed by return.

Wait a minute or two for the device to restart, and then reconnect over SSH again, using the same method from Step 5. e.g. ```ssh digbyte@diginode.local```

It will prompt you for your password again. When it reconnects, you should then see the DigiNode MOTD, reminding you of the commands to manage your DigiNode.

To check on the status of you DigiNode, launch the Status Monitor by typing ```diginode``` followed by return.

Press Q to quit the status monitor.

The final step is to setup port forwarding for the DigiNode.

### Some Useful Linux Commands

If you are new to Linux, you may find these commands useful. You can type each one into the terminal and press return.

- ```exit``` - disconnect from the Raspberry Pi
- ```ls``` - view the contents of the current directory
- ```ls -all``` - view the contents of the current directory, including any hidden files or directories
- ```cd <directory path>``` - Navigate into a directory. e.g. ```cd ~/.digibyte```
- ```cd ..``` - Navigate out of the current directory.
- ```cd ~``` - Return to the home folder.
- ```nano <file name>``` - Edit a file using nano. e.g. ```nano ~/.digibyte/diginode.settings```
- ```sudo raspi-config``` - Launch the 'Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool' (use it to configure wifi, overclock the Pi etc.)
- ```sudo apt-get update``` - Check for system updates.
- ```sudo apt-get upgrade``` - Install system updates.
- ```sudo reboot``` - Reboot the system.
- ```sudo systemctl restart digibyted``` - Restart DigiByte full node.
- ```sudo systemctl restart ipfs``` - Restart IPFS.
- ```pm2 restart digiasset``` - Restart DigiAsset Node.
