Note: These instructions are for Windows users. If you are using macOS, please follow the instructions [here](/docs/rpi_setup_macos.md) Windows users..

## Before You Begin

A Raspberry Pi offers one of the easiest setups on which to run a dedicated DigiNode. A Raspberry Pi 4 8GB or better is recommended, booting from an SSD. For a complete list of suggested hardware, see [here](/docs/suggested_hardware.md).

These instructions will take you though all the steps required to setup your DigiNode on a Raspberry Pi. They have been written with less technical users in mind, and should hopefully be easy for anyone to follow.
