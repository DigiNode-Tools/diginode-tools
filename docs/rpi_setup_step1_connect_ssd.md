# DigiNode Setup on a Raspberry Pi - Step-by-Step Instructions

## STEP 1 - Connect the DigiNode SSD to your computer

To install the operating system for your DigiNode, you will first need to connect the SSD you are using to your Mac computer. You can then use the 'Raspberry Pi Imager' software to "burn" the operating system on to the SSD.

Depending on the type of enclosure you are using for your Raspberry Pi, your SSD will either be in an external case like have an SSD in a seperate external case, or it is built

**External SSD**



**Internal SSD**

To connect the internal SSD to your Mac you will need a USB cable to connect it. Newer Macs only have USB-C ports, so you will need a USB-C to USB-A cable. If your Mac is older and has USB-A ports (the big rectangular one) , you can use to USB-A to USB-C cable. You can find these on Amazon etc. if you don't already have one.

In the case of the Argon M.2 One case (see image below), you need to connect one end of the cable to the USB-A port of the internal SSD. Then connect the other end of the cable to your Mac.
