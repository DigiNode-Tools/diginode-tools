# Build your own DigiNode

To buid your own DigiNode, you will need a Raspberry Pi 4 8Gb with power supply, SSD and case. Links for suggested items are below. For the case and SSD, two options have been provided to suit different budgets.

## Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8Gb
![Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8Gb](/images/rpi4_8gb.jpg)

The Rasperry Pi 4 Model B is available in 8Gb, 4Gb, 2Gb and 1Gb models. DigiByte Core requires at least 5Gb RAM to run. For this reason, the 8Gb model Pi 4 is highly reccomended. While the 4Gb model will work, it requires a swap file which will work the SSD hard and performance will be very sluggish. Fine for testing, but not recommended for long term use. The 2Gb and 1Gb models are not supported.

As of July 2022, due to the global chip shortage, the Raspberry Pi 4 is still experiencing stock shortages, and may currently unavailable at the provided links. You can monitor global stock availability at the [rpilocator website](https://rpilocator.com/). You can also sign up for stock alerts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rpilocator) or [Telegram](https://t.me/raspberry_alert_pi). Be wary of price gouging - the MSRP of the Pi4 8Gb is $75 USD.

## Genuine Raspberry Pi 4 PSU
![Raspberry Pi 4 PSU](/images/rpi4_psu.jpg)

Aftermarket power supplies can be cheaper but are frequently prone to voltage issues. Since the Pi is also powering the SSD, it is highly recommnded to purchase a genuine official Raspberry Pi 4 power supply.

# Option A: Argon One M.2 Case with internal SSD

| **Pros**                                          | **Cons**                             			     |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| More compact - SSD is enclosed in the Pi case  	| Not the cheapest option     			             |
| Active cooling (Fan included)                     | 		                                             |
| Better performance with an optional NVME SSD      | 		                                             |

## Argon ONE M.2 Case for Raspberry Pi 4 (SATA SSD Model)
![Argon One M.2 Case](/images/argon_m2.jpg)

The Argon One case is aluminium which helps to passively cool the Pi, and the SSD is housed within the case making the entire device nice and compact. The fan can be controlled by software to activate it at the desired temperature threshold.

Note that there are two variants of the Argon One M.2 Case - one that supports a M.2 SATA SSD (slower) and the other supports a M.2 NVME SSD (faster). Both are suitable but you need to buy the correct SSD to match your chosen case. (See SSD info below.). These links are for the SATA case.

## M.2 SATA SSD
![M.2 SATA SSD](/images/m2_sata_ssd.jpg)

You need to choose the correct type of M.2 SSD depending on which Argon M.2 case you choose - SATA or NVME. NVME is newer technology and faster, but SATA is more than adequate for a DigiNode, unless you want the extra performance. Note that M.2 NVME and M.2 SATA connectors are different - SATA connectors have one slot whereas NVME connectors have two. Learn more about the diference between NVMA and SATA [here](https://www.pcguide.com/ssd/guide/nvme-vs-m-2-vs-sata/). The links below are for a SATA SSD.

As of July 2022, a DigiNode requires ~40GB of space. You can choose any size of SSD you want that is larger than this. I recommend a 250Gb SSD, or 500Gb to be more future proof.

## USB A to USB A Cable
![USB A to USB A Cable](/images/usb_atoa_cable.jpg)

Since the SSD is enclosed in the Argon One case, this cable makes it possible to connect the SSD directly to your computer to copy over the operating system image. Without it you will likely need to first boot the Raspberry Pi from Raspberry Pi OS a microSD card and then burn the image on to the SSD from that making the setup process longer and more complicated. This cable makes the setup process much simpler, and avoids unnecesary headaches! It is optional but highly recommended.

# Option B: Flirc Case with external SSD

| **Pros**              | **Cons**                             			     |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Cheaper   			| Passive Cooling Only (No Fan)     				 |
|   					| Less compact (SSD is in a seperate case) 			 |

## Flirc Case for Raspberry Pi 4
![Flirc case](/images/flirc_case.jpg)

This Flirc case is made of aluminium, and the entire case acts as a heat sync to keep your Pi cool. It does not inculde a fan. During the intial sync of the blockchain it can get quite hot, but the rest of the time is should be fine. If you choose a case without a fan make sure it has passive cooling of some kind.
