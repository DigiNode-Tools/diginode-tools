# Suggested DigiNode Hardware

To buid your own DigiNode, you need a Rasperry Pi 4 8Gb and then a case

## Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8Gb
Purchase:
[Amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/3alBS9k)

Note: Running DigiByte Core requires ~5Gb RAM. For this reason, an 8Gb Pi is strongly reccomemned. A 4Gb Pi will work but it will require a swap file, and performance will be very sluggish. For this reason, a 4Gb Pi is fine for testing, but for long term use, an 8Gb (or greater) Pi is highly recommeded.

## Genuine Raspberry Pi 4 PSU
Purchase:
[Amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/3P5YtFI)
[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3ae8To1)

Note: Aftermarket power supplies can be cheaper but are frequently prone to voltage issues. Since the Pi is also powering the SSD, it is highly recommnded to purchase a genuine official Raspberry Pi 4 power supply.

# Option A: Argon One M.2 Case

| **Pros**                                          | **Cons**                             			     |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| More compact - SSD is enclosed in the Pi case  	| Not the cheapest option     			             |
| Active cooling (Fan included)                     | 		                                             |
| Better performance with an NVME SSD               | 		                                             |

## Argon ONE M.2 for Raspberry Pi 4
Purchase:
[Amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/3alBS9k)
Note: There are two variants of the Argon One M.2 case - one that supports a M.2 SATA SSD and the other supports a M.2 NVME SSD. Either will work but you need to buy the correct SSD to match your chosen case.(See below.)

## M.2 SSD
Purchase:

Note: You need to choose the correct type of M.2 SSD depending on which type your case supports - SATA or NVME. SATA is older and slower. NVME is newer and faster. SATA is more than adequate for a DigiNode, unless you want the extra performance. More info [here](https://www.pcguide.com/ssd/guide/nvme-vs-m-2-vs-sata/).



# Option B: Flirc Case

| **Pros**              | **Cons**                             			     |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Cheaper   			| Passive Cooling Only (No Fan)     				 |
|   					| Less compact (SSD is in a seperate case) 			 |

## Flirc Case for Raspberry Pi 4
Purchase:
[Amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/3IjCkRV)
[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3R5abSN)
[Amazon.ca](https://amzn.to/3P1YcDA)
Note: The Flirc case is made of aluminium, and the entire case acts as a heat sync. It does not inculde a fan. During the intial sync of the blockchain it can get quite hot, but the rest of the time is should be fine. If you choose a case without fan make sure it has passive cooling of some kind.

## Orico USB 3.1 10Gbps USB-C SSD Enclosure
Purchase: [Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3P4VTQh) [Amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/3ydNfbf) [Amazon.nl](https://amzn.to/3yh6Asc)
Note: You can use whichever SSD enclosure you like but try to to ensure it is at least USB 3.1 Gen 2 10Gbps. Some enclosures are only 6Gbps.

## Crucial 2.5" SSD
Purchase:
[Amazon.co.uk](https://amzn.to/3IjFNjF)
Note: As of July 2022, DigiNode requires ~40GB of space. You can choose any size of SSD you want that is larger than this. I recomend 250Gb or 500Gb to be future proof.
