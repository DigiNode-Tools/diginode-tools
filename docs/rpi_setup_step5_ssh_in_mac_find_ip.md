# DigiNode Setup on a Raspberry Pi - Step-by-Step Instructions

Note: If you have not already connected the SSD to your Raspberry Pi and powered it on, then go [here](/docs/rpi_setup_step4_boot_pi.md) to complete STEP 4.

## STEP 5 - Connect to the Pi over SSH from macOS

### Step 5.3 - Discover the IP address of the Raspberry Pi

You may be able to discover the IP address of the Raspberry Pi by logging into the web interface of your router and looking for it in the list of connected devices. Alternatively, you can use an IP address scanner, which is the method we will be using here. We will be using the free software called 'Angry IP Scanner'.

Open Safari, and visit [https://angryip.org/](https://angryip.org/) and click the 'Free Download' button.
